          <p>Web3 denomination appeared for the first time in 2006. But it also gained popularity in 2021.<br/> The industry is still new but a lot of people, companies, organization dug in and took huge benefit making their brand set for the future.<br/> Founders like Vitalik Buterin of <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/"><b>Ethereum</b></a>, Devin Finzer of <a href="https://opensea.io/"><b>Opensea</b></a>, Jihoz of <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/"><b>Axie Infinity</b></a>, etc...<br/><br/>
            
           But here in the Philippines, Web3 is not known by the majority.<br/> Imagine what we, the community, could bring to our country with all of these Web3 platforms that will create amazing projects, build jobs, and meet new exciting people.<br/><br/>
